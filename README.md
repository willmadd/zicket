## Timing Breakdown

Hour 1 : Install React, Redux, Laravel and dependancies, configure tailwind, implement basic routing and set up git repo.

Hour 2 : Set up basic Laravel End points, create sample api json file and get it returning on when route hit. Use Axios in the FE to populate page content from laravel into Redux
